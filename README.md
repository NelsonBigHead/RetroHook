## RetroHook
RetroHook is an x86/x64, minimalistic header only library for placing hooks on virtual-functions. Ease and stealth is a priority, and future updates are inevitable. The library doesn't change any data of the address, bypassing any data checks, and also doesn't require `VirtualProtect` to be called on the address. RetroHook was compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, but should be no problem building on any other compiler.

## Requirements
